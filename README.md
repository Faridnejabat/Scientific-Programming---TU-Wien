# Scientific Programming with Python - Course Assignments

This repository houses my work for the "Scientific Programming with Python" course undertaken at TU Wien. It includes a series of assignments that demonstrate the application of Python in scientific programming, emphasizing data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving in an engineering context.

## Overview

The assignments are designed to test various aspects of Python programming, from basic syntax and data structures to more advanced concepts such as data manipulation with Pandas, numerical analysis with Numpy, and data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn. These projects were completed as part of my master's curriculum, showcasing both foundational and advanced skills in Python programming.

### Assignment 1: Data Analysis and Visualization

- **Objective**: Analyze a dataset to extract meaningful insights and visualize the results using Python's data analysis libraries.
- **Key Concepts**: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, data visualization.

### Assignment 2: Optimization and Machine Learning

- **Objective**: Implement optimization algorithms and apply machine learning techniques to solve a specific engineering problem.
- **Key Concepts**: Machine learning algorithms, optimization techniques, model evaluation, predictive modeling.

## Skills and Tools

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Concepts**: Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Optimization, Visualization

## Installation and Usage

To run these notebooks, ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
