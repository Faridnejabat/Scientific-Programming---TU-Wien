# Scientific Programming with Python - TU Wien Coursework

Welcome to my collection of assignments from the 'Scientific Programming with Python' course at TU Wien. This repository showcases a variety of Python's applications in scientific computing and data analysis, reflecting my skills in leveraging Python to tackle diverse scientific challenges.

## Course Overview

The course focused on harnessing Python's capabilities for scientific purposes, including data visualization, symbolic mathematics, and manipulating complex datasets.

## Assignments Overview

### Assignment 1: Dynamic Visualization and Data Analysis

- **Summary**: Created interactive plots for polynomial functions using `ipywidgets` and analyzed datasets with `pandas`, visualizing the results with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- **Key Concepts**: Interactive plotting, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis.

### Assignment 2: RGB Color Intensity Adjustment and Symbolic Mathematics

- **Task 1 (RGB Color Adjustment)**: Developed a tool to dynamically adjust the RGB color intensity of an image using `ipywidgets`, with live updates displayed via `matplotlib`.
- **Task 2 (Symbolic Mathematics)**: Utilized `sympy` to compute the area under curves defined by symbolic expressions, further plotting these functions and calculating the bounded area above the x-axis.

### Assignment Methodologies

- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Employed `ipywidgets` for creating dynamic, user-interactive visualizations for real-time data exploration.
- **Image Processing**: Adjusted and visualized image color intensities in real-time, demonstrating the manipulation of image data.
- **Symbolic Mathematics**: Applied `sympy` for solving complex mathematical problems symbolically, including finding roots of equations and integrating functions to calculate areas under curves.

## Technical Skills

- **Languages and Libraries**: Proficient in Python, with extensive use of libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `ipywidgets`, and `sympy`.
- **Analytical Skills**: Strong capabilities in analyzing and visualizing complex datasets, symbolic mathematics, and algorithmic problem-solving.
