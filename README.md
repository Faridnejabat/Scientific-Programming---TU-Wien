# Scientific Programming with Python - TU Wien Assignments

Welcome to my repository for the 'Scientific Programming with Python' course assignments at TU Wien. These projects reflect a comprehensive engagement with Python's capabilities in scientific computing, from dynamic data visualization to the analysis of molecular structures.

## Course Overview

The course emphasizes the development of Python programming skills for scientific research applications. It covers a wide array of topics, including but not limited to data analysis, visualization, and the manipulation of complex datasets.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Dynamic Plotting and Visualization

- **Summary**: Implemented an interactive plotter for polynomial functions using `ipywidgets`. This assignment demonstrates the ability to create dynamic visualizations that respond to user input.
- **Key Concepts**: `matplotlib`, `numpy`, dynamic plotting with `ipywidgets`.

### Assignment 2: Visualizing Vienna's Subway System

- **Summary**: Developed a program to plot the routes of Vienna's subway lines on a map of the city. This involved parsing and visualizing geographic data from CSV files.
- **Key Concepts**: Data parsing, geographic visualization, `pandas`, `matplotlib`.

### Assignment 3: Data Intersection

- **Summary**: Created a function to compute the intersection of two datasets based on student IDs, merging data from different exams.
- **Key Concepts**: Data manipulation, efficient search and merge algorithms.
